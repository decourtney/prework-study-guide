# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is intended to provide a central location to store key notes for a Prework Study Guide project.
The purpose of building this project was to learn some of the basics for creating webpages with a hands-on approach. 
The prework starts with a very basic look at computers and quickly increases in complexity by introducing some basic 
programming concepts and then on to creating a simple webpage. The webpage doubles as location for me to keep key notes
to refer back to throughout the Coding Bootcamp.

## Usage

Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if you open the DevTools console, 
You can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics I learned from prework and choose one topic for me to study first.
